git clone https://github.com/Abhay-Bajpai/Legal_analysis.git
cd Legal_analysis/legal_analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
⚙️ Usage
To start training and evaluating your model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py
Ensure that your data is compatible with the expected format in load_data.py.

🧠 Features
Legal text preprocessing with stopword removal and lemmatization

TF-IDF vectorization

ML model training and evaluation (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM)

Word clouds, frequency plots, and class distribution visualizations

📈 Planned Improvements
Add support for transformer-based models (e.g., BERT)

Build a web interface for easier usage

Expand to multi-label legal classifications
