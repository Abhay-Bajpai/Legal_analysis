Legal Analysis
A Python-based toolkit for performing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning-driven legal document analysis. This project aims to assist legal professionals, researchers, and developers in extracting insights and performing classification on legal texts using modern NLP techniques.

📌 Features
Text Preprocessing: Efficient tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization tailored for legal texts.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize term frequency, class distribution, and word clouds.

Model Training & Evaluation: Train classification models to categorize legal documents (e.g., judgments, petitions).

Modular Design: Clean, maintainable, and extensible code structure using Python modules and classes.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To train and evaluate a model on your dataset:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py
Ensure that your data is correctly formatted and loaded via load_data.py.
